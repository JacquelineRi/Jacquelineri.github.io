    <h3> Photography </h3>
    <p>
    Another pasttime I enjoy is photography. I have admired other people's work for a long time, and took it upon myself
    to hone this as a hobby. One college course later, I feel I've improved and cannot wait to get better!
    I love capturing precious moments and loved ones!
    </p>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p> I could not be the person I am today without video games. They provide me sanctuary. To immerse myself in precious moments and memories in a digital worlds
        where I can adventure and live in new ways. In a stressful, sad, or lovely day I find refuge. From lovely songs such as Kingdom Heart's Dearly Beloved, to beautiful motivational quotes,
        I vouch for the greatness to be discovered and enjoyed from video games! 
    </p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
    Music is something I hold dearly to me. It is motivating, comforting, and relatable! 
    I additionally attend concerts. Catch me struggling to watch my favorite artists in a crowd of taller people. 
    I still won't trade the feeling of seeing your favorite artist and singing my heart out for anything!
