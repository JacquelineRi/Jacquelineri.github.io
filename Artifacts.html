        <h2> Biography </h2>
        <p> There are multiple areas of interest I have acquired throughout my progression in my Information Science major. Front-end development and proficiency in several languages such as HTML and CSS, back-end development including databases, and pertinent languages like Python and PHP, general web design, and information architecture are among the comprehensive interests I have explored and nurtured.
        Several classes equipped me with a myriad of skills pertinent to web development. For example, the project-based Information Architecture course helped me develop appropriate research skills and dynamic problem-solving abilities for each unique case in web development. The guidance and nurture of these techniques allow me to effectively evaluate users’ needs and the services they require. It is furthermore enhanced by the user-centered approach with conscientious efforts support the goals and needs of users, emphasized throughout the course. Other courses helped me hone and develop technical skills such as HTML and CSS within my Web Page Design management course. Finally, some courses helped with the often overlooked but critical soft skills in information technology fields. Different formats and styles were explored from memos to project proposals that facilitate the progression of projects from start to end. Furthermore, there are several skills, software, and tools I have garnered and nurtured for my web development occupation. My skills include efficient coding skills and logical framework, user-centered design, soft skills for collaboration and communication, research skills and methods in user needs such as user personas and card sorting, low and high-fidelity wireframing, database design, and proficiency in front-end languages like HTML and back end languages such as Python. Software tools I have developed proficiency in are Balsamiq for wireframing and Visual Studio Code for coding. 
        I have had unique volunteering experiences utilizing skills relevant to web design, such as effective communication and understanding customer needs. I provided website updates for a previous employer in need of updating and editing their website’s content. I addressed issues such as images displaying correctly, and allowing users to browse and access available products effectively. My contributions enable customers to get a positive and helpful experience from the business’ website. This volunteer experience contributed to my future aspirations in providing support to local Hispanic businesses. I plan to assist local owners in Chicago, aiming to create enticing, accessible websites for businesses to provide online services and reach more clients. These humble beginnings portray a need for further initiative for work experience and volunteer experience that make me and my stakeholders confident in my applications to web development. 
        Thank you for considering me to bring your dreams to life online! My goal is to help stakeholders’ dreams flourish online on their ideal website. With my experience and comprehensive skill set in web design, I strive to encapsulate the content desired into an enjoyable site so they can share the reverie with their users!
